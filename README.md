This is of my very first exercises.

It involves
- Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
- Create a file named README.md in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
- Edit the contents of the README.md file.
- If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
